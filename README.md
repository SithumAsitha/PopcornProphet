PopcornProphet-Movie Recommendation System 

Movie recommendation systems have become a vital part of our lives in the era of digital
entertainment, guiding viewers toward potential favorites. We set out on a data-driven adventure to
improve the movie-watching experience, using a dataset we downloaded from Kaggle. Our system of
movie recommendations, which tries to suggest relevant films when a user types in a given movie
name, is built on the dataset.
To accomplish this, we rigorously processed and normalized our data in order to assure its accuracy
and consistency. The dataset must go through this preparation process in order to be ready for
analysis and recommendation. Furthermore, to create a new data frame that serves as the foundation
of our recommendation engine, we used sophisticated approaches including detecting comparable
films and applying cosine similarity.
Come along on this fascinating tour of the world of cinematic data analysis as we investigate the
impact of studios, uncover the mechanisms behind movie suggestions, and enable consumers to find
the next big movie that appeals to their individual tastes.
